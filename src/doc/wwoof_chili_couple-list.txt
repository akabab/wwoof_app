My name is Thomas Matthijs, I am from Holland , I travelled around the world several times and came across this natural paradise in Patagonia , Chile. I fell in love with the valley , the waterfalls , the untouched jungle (Cold Jungle) I am active and enterprising , but need help building log cabins, perfecting my dams, turbines and windgenerators to make electricity. I also bought materials to build a katamaran and heaps of tools for all kinds of mad scientist projects. I own this beach right on the estuary. Plenty of fishing seafood, swimming kayaking and more. Dolphins and curious sealions often come spy on us strange human beings . I heard a ferocious roar of a puma a while ago. Scared the shit out of me. All I need is a few helping hands as the challenges of survival in pure unadulterated nature are many . Lodging in tent, meals rich in fish. Come see . Adelante. Bienvenidos! But I need wwoofers to remain minimum 3 weeks or more. I also welcome quality people to participate long term while the Northern Hemisphere falls apart , You will not spend a penny here but I DO require volunteers to bring some food ( contact me and read my instructions carefully).
To arrive, take a night bus from SANTIAGO Terminal de buses, to Puerto Montt, leaves 7 PM arrives 9 AM (several lines), fairly comfortable usually costs US$30 (look for promotions). Nice little town. Recommend hostals, usually around US$10 at night. On Saturday morning take a bus to Quellon (Southern tip of island of Chiloe) 6 hours, US$15. Only Saturday night 7 PM there is a ferry (barcasa ) to Raul Marin Balmaceda, arriving 9 AM ( cost US$15) .......if you take a sleeping bag you might just sleep comfortably on deck , but if raining stay seated in large room with lots fishermen and locals . Guard your belongings as you would in any country. Arriving in Puerto Raul Marin B. find ANY fisherman going upstream to take you to “el holandés”, Thomas Mateo . I usually pay $5000 chilean pesos (USD10) for a ride for one or two passengers. There are no regular services in this part of the world, relax,. time passes differently here .....

Our place is in the bottom of Rio Claro valley in Aysen, Patagonia. It's 16 km. off Coyhaique. How to arrive? By plane or boat! from Puerto Montt to Balmaceda or Port Chacabuco. Once in Coyhaique you will stay at home and next day I’ll take them to the countryside. We have a small cabin for maximum two persons, with bed and utensils to cook. The woofers will be alone, they MUST BE self suffisant (independents) and able to survive in rustic conditions. I use to provide meals in agree with diet volunteers. But He/She/they must prepare their food. There’s a stove and wood enough to cook and keep you warm and comfortable. There is no electrical light, neither hot water, nor toilet inside. Mobile phone signal is available.
I hope the volunteer works 5 hours at day OR TO SEE RESULTS in terrain. I need INSTALL a system to collect water from the river or a fountainhead nearby (2014): removing rotten trunks, to do cairns (small rock walls aside the path) to separate sectors. I also need volunteers able of building basic facilities. It ́s a good place for trekking, swimming (January and February) watching bird. It is a precious place, with a natural swimming pool of close river and is beside a Park CONAF Preservation of Huemules (Hemul is a chilean deer in risk to be extint).

We live on the coast of Piti-Palena estuary, where we have cleared a small spot in the cold jungle covering this isolated Chilean Patagonia area entirely. The place is completely different from any other place you may have visited around the world. Time seems to have remained static for the past fifty years here. There is no pollution, and civilization has not reached us yet. The only way to get to this place is by boat from a small village and port called Raul Marin Balmaceda. There are no highways or roads or even paths, since the rainforest is too thick and hillsides are too steep to make way for roads. Access is along rivers and canals only. We have room for wwoofers in our place, which is located opposite the estuary, far away from town. We hope the experience of living in this place for a while, and working so close to our origins and to Mother Earth will enable you to develop new skills. We are a couple endeavoring to implement a project that includes a trekking trail across the jungle to reach a hidden lake, a camping site, and prodution of some organic vegetables in the greenhouse. We love to benefit on resources coming from this land and this ocean. Rodrigo speaks English and Portuguese moderately. He has lived here for 20 years. Beatriz will cook delicious healthy food for us. We and the volunteers will work on and perform various tasks, such as fishing and smoking fish,

Welcome to Fundo Panguilemu! Thank you for your interest in being a volunteer with us. The farm (fundo) is 1000 ha. of which half is beech forest and the rest is rolling to hilly pasture.

We are available to show and explain all aspects of Holistic Management, from the Holistic Context and Grazing Planning through to the practicalities of electric fencing and stock movements. (www.savoryinstitute.com). We are a family starting out on our own farming adventure, a husband and wife team. Jose Manuel is a trained veterinarian who specializes in ovine production through his business in Punta Arenas (www.ovitec.cl). Elizabeth, originally from New Zealand with a background in dairy farming. Together we purchased Fundo Panguilemu in 2013. Jose Manuel has two kids, who join us on the farm during school holidays. We also have a baby daughter. Depending on the time of year and availability you might stay in a tent, a small room in the sheep shed or a rustic hut. You will be able to join us for family meals in our home or perhaps a BBQ in the evening. Plans change from day to day, but you might be asked to help in any of the following!: Cutting, washing and preparing vegetable for sale/ Weeding, seeding or transplanting in the greenhouses or garden / Attending the hens – feeding, cleaning, collecting eggs / Preparing for and attending visitors / Delivery of products to clients / Stacking and chopping firewood / Moving mobs of animals on foot or horseback / Preparing meals, washing dishes or helping in the farm house / Seasonal work such as shearing, lamb marking, artificial insemination of the sheep, weighing cattle, etc.
You do not need to have experience in any of these areas – only a willingness to learn and work hard!
If you have any skills that you would like to offer, (construction, mechanics, photography, cooking etc) then please let us know so we can offer you some tasks in that area! . The farm is just 11 km. outside of Coyhaique, a town of around 40,000 residents. The easiest way to get here is on a flight with LAN or Skyairlines from Santiago to Balmaceda. The airport in Balmaceda, is south of Coyhaique and there are options for either a bus or transfer van to bring you to Coyhaique (1 hour). From there we can arrange for you to be brought to the farm.

At the farm we are mainly involved in the rearing of livestock, especially sheep and cattle but we also have some pigs. We are self sufficient in our own produce from the farm gardens and orchards. Overlooking Llanquihue lake and Osorno volcano the farm is set in the beautiful surroundings of the Chilean Lake District. It can rain quite often here, so it is advisable to bring lightweight waterproof clothing, even in the summer. Help is mainly required with animal husbandry and general farm maintenance such as building and repairing fences, pens, etc, according to seasonal needs. In addition there may be some work with fruit and vegetable production. Woofers are housed in separate spacious accommodation, built in the traditional German style that is common in this area. Three separate bedrooms are available. This is approximately one kilometre from the main farm buildings, where we meet each day and where all main meals are provided. You are advised to bring a torch with you for the walk back to your accommodation after supper. We have three children of various ages, who all enjoy helping out on the farm when they are not in school.

I am Cathy Bérard, and I am in charge of La Colina Farm and an island close to the farm. My main activity is tourism. I am doing horse back riding programs and my horses are in the farm. I am needing somebody pro active that speak Spanish, knows about farm work to help the farm keeper that lives in the farm. Pedro, the farm keeper, need to have somebody that will be following him and learning being his “shadow”. Somebody that will like to learn how is life in an isolated farm in the Andes. As I will be very busy for the whole summer, I was thinking to work with woofers that can stay and help Pedro, for almost one or two months at least. For the moment (2016) I need somebody responsible hardworking and honest, and not exceeded with alcohol. Have good attitude with the community (neighbors) and initiative.There is a house with 2 rooms and bathroom with hot water that is heated by a wood stove. For cooking the same stove that is working with wood, with all the risks involved in a wood building. Something to really take care about. The farm have no electricity, there is not phone sign and we have a generator for some lights at night and a solar panel for charging the radio. At 5' walking from there there is a river and at 45' the Las Rocas lake. The main and unique gravel road that goes into the Valley it's crossing the farm. Not very busy. No many people around, and one bus per day to make a 200km trip to the biggest closes city, Puerto Montt. There is also a hamlet at 16km, Llanada Grande, with groceries stores public telephone and wifi access. There are a lot of things to do, maintenance of the buildings, taking care and watching the animals, and painting, fixing, etc. We have mostly lambs and horses. During the summer, with the horse rides the rangers are staying for one night there in each trip. So they will share the house and have good moments at diner time. It is a good time to learn about horses and equipment. I will need that who will stay there, also can be in charge of giving and receiving all the equipment with the horses and be responsible for that. In the rides there is a lot of logistic and we need help with luggage of the clients arriving and supplies. It's important to be there and receive this and be in connection with the Island to send everything there. Pedro knows very well that logistic, so basically we need somebody to help Pedro. Communications are by radio. The person or couple that would be interested in helping me this summer have to know that it is a beautiful place but as many places close to nature have not all the "comfort" of a house in the town and that it is a very quiet, isolated and also safe place. It is really for people that enjoy nature and want to make a living experience in a farm in the Andes.The Puelo valley is one of the lowest valleys to cross the Andes and very close to Argentina across Paso El Bolsón.

The homestead is located on the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Ancud. The primary design parameters of the site design are strong winds, the soil characteristics and the water supply. Richard bought the land in 2003 and has lived there full-time for three years. For reasons of health and a long-term interest in “outreach” or social responsibility, the development and operation of the homestead now requires the help of more able bodies and inquisitive minds. The underlying philosophy of the project is Sharing. Organic gardening and farming can quite righteously be considered as an end unto itself, for the direct benefit of the gardener and family, or - equally valid - the objective of the activities can be to provide a means for the learning and application of attitudes that go beyond mere productivity and nutrition. It is not a vegetarian homestead although no domestic animals are being raised at present, and I am not ideological nor a “preacher”. Common chores involve helping in the 650 square meters of an expanding vegetable garden, the construction of greenhouses and tunnels, tending flowers, getting in firewood, simple carpentry and landscaping. Projects also include preparing a group of camp sites on the property and organizing boating activities for tourists and local young people learning nautical skills (sea kayaks and open boats). Gathering seaweed from the beaches and managing the compost bins, cutting lawns and blackberry and other bushes, tending to the raspberry patch and trimming the hedge that is the windbreak for the camping area are all occasional chores. A rototiller is used sparingly and other motorized/mechanical devices as well as wheel-barrows are part of the system.
Before their arrival, it is best to communicate with you directly by Email in Spanish or English. Volunteers’ lodging has often been in WWOOFER’s own tents, and there is a covered area available for periods of heavy rainfall. Now there is a mini-cabin available for one or more volunteers. Meals are prepared and shared in Richard’s cottage. We take turns with kitchen chores. There is Wi/Fi for Internet access, and there is a new latrine for visitors and volunteers in order to take pressure off the cottage’s septic system. Apart from the immediate, personal benefits of living in retirement on such a lovely and nourishing piece of land– I just celebrated my 70th birthday in December 2014, with all of the therapeutic activities involved in its improvement and maintenance, the stated objective of the whole program is to donate the property as the primary asset of a small foundation – a nonprofit organization that would sustain windows of opportunity open for future generations and demonstrate a variety of skills, techniques and attitudes to the inhabitants of and visitors to the surrounding coastal areas of the archipelago.
Richard has had experience in organic agriculture in New England, USA, in the 1960 ́s, and in southern Chile since he arrived here in the early 1970’s. For you to get here there are public buses from Chacao and Ancud, by sea or walking or by bicycle. Work schedules are flexible; a number of volunteers have used the homestead as a base camp for short or more extended trips around the island or farther south in Patagonia. Staying one month or more, preferently two people.

We are a family living on Chiloe Island, sustainably farming and ecotourism are our principal activities. Our farm is in Guabún, northwest of Ancud and along the ocean but we live in Ancud with the wwoofers. We share the farm with my mother who lives and works there full time along with another farmhand. Our principle crop are strawberries and that's where we need the most help: planting, harvesting, weeding. Also potatoes and another vegetables. To get to the farm, we will drive you from Ancud. The journee starts at 8 starting from Ancud and finish at 14:30 returning to the city. This time may change on strawberries harvest. There is windy and rainy here, so waterproof jacket and rubber boots are recommended. Chiloe is a beautiful island with natural wonders to explore. Much of our heritage is preserved and living on the farm is rustic and peaceful. Basic Spanish required. 2 weeks to stay or more.
